# counter-project
This is a simple project using HTML, CSS, and JAVASCRIPT, with a minimalistic design. The basic function is just to count when a button is pressed.
The increase button adds 1 to existing number, and the decrease button substracts 1 from the existing number, and the reset button simply sets the number to 0.
I trid to make the website a little responsive as well.
I tried to keep the overall look of the website simple and aesthetic.
